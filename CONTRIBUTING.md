# JSONsite
JSONsite allows you to take a JSON file and turn it into a SPA with mini pages.

Here are the steps to make it work (in order):
- The engine will fetch the JSON and parse it
- metatags-style.js generates the metatag and add the `<html>` tags.
- navbar.js will make the navbar and jumbotron
- pages.js will make the mini pages
- logic.js makes the pages work generated by pages.js. It hides and shows the pages based on the fragment (`https://domain.tld/#fragment`)
- custom.js will add custom CSS and JavaScript added by the user
- footer.js will add a footer, like `Copyright User 2020` or `Made with JSONsite with â™¥`
- minify.js will minify the HTML to improve the speed of the webpage loading

It's really complicated because I made this in like ~12 hours so, eh. I plan on rewritting this with EJS later but
